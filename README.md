# SentientOps

A simple RAG system built step by step.

🎯 Project Goal

Modern production systems generate massive amounts of logs, metrics, and traces — but engineers still spend hours manually debugging incidents.

SentientOps aims to:

- Observe system signals (logs, metrics, traces)

- Understand what is happening across services

- Explain issues in clear, human-readable language

- Assist engineers with safe, actionable next steps

In short:

Turn raw operational data into operational understanding.

## 📚 Documentation

*   **[Execution Guide](execution.md)**: Detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and monitor the system (Docker & Local).
*   **[Code Reference](code_reference.md)**: Technical documentation for the codebase, explaining modules, functions, and variables.
